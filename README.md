# ShmooCon Ticket Bot Dashboard ðŸŽ«ðŸ¤–
*This is part of a proof-of-concept bot to automatically purchase tickets for ShmooCon, a conference that is notoriously hard to get tickets for. [See more info here.](https://github.com/ShmooConTix/ticket-bot)*

## About / Features
This serves as the "user facing" portion of the ticket bot / API. *Everything* is configured and managed through here. It is built with NextJS, Shadcn, and Tailwind (basically everything you'd expect from a vibe coded SaaS). Below are the main features of the dashboard:

- Dashboard with live statistics via WebSocket
- Key-value configuration management through [the API](https://github.com/ShmooConTix/api)
- User management (as in, who will the bot get the tickets for)
- Global state management with Zustand
- Very nice looking UI
- "Riddle Mode," which allows humans to solve riddles instead of AI *(this wasn't used in the final project)*

## Installation
To run a development environment, you can run the API through the `Dockerfile`. Make sure you expose the necessary ports. If you aren't familiar with Docker, please consult the documentation.

## Contributing
